This is a FORK of https://github.com/nacitar/a.vim

Changes:

- Fix typo in definition of C extension mappings
- Change override mechanism from g:alternateExtensions_{filetype}_{extension} to
  b:alternateExtensionsDict so that extensions with multiple dots ('.') can be
  configured in override. Allow maxDotsInExtension to be overridden.
- When determining extension, search for longest match so that an extension that
  includes another valid extension as a substring (e.g., ".abc.d" and ".d") is
  detected correctly

A few of quick commands to switch between source files and header files quickly.

:A switches to the header file corresponding to the current file being edited (or vise versa)
:AS splits and switches
:AV vertical splits and switches
:AT new tab and switches
:AN cycles through matches
:IH switches to file under cursor
:IHS splits and switches
:IHV vertical splits and switches
:IHT new tab and switches
:IHN cycles through matches

E.g. if you are editing foo.c and need to edit foo.h simply execute :A and you will be editing foo.h, to switch back to foo.c execute :A again.

Can be configured to support a variety of languages. Builtin support for C, C++, Objective C[++], Coffee Script, Cython and ADA95
